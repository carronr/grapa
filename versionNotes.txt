- Added method attr() to the class Curve, a shorter alias to Graph.getAttribute()
Improvements
- Improved the reliability of CV and Cf script processing versus noisy data and incomplete input files.
BUGS
- The attribute label is now parsed as a string, so Curve labels such as "1", "2" can be used.


Version 0.5.4.0
NOT RELEASED
- Read CSV export files of the SquidAdmiral system
- Implemented automatic processing of Jsc-Voc data. Careful, the fit limits may be quite off from reasonable values.
BUGS
- Modified the output of scriptJV so samples with name purely numerical correctly proceed through the script
- Solved a bug in script Cf that prevented the correct display of the map dC/dln(f) vs T vs frequency.
- Solved a bug in script CV that stopped the execution when for some reason, negative values of N_CV were computed.

Version 0.4.1.0
Released 13.11.2017
Additions
- A (hopefully) user-friendly window to manage the text annotations, accessible from the "Text annotations" button above the plot.
- XRF html file: CIGS composition also computed from Cu/Se, Ga/Se ratios
- Support of EQE files from CSU (Colorado State University, Sites' group)
- Several default image formats can be configured in the config.txt file, with a line like "save_imgformat	['.eps', '.png']"
- Curve EQE: The Urbach decay energy can now be fitted, as a Curve action.
- Curve SIMS: when generating a elemental ratio Curve, the user can now specify window and degree of a SAvistky-Golay smoothening filter to be applied on each of the elemental traces
- The boxplot script can now create boxplots from various data files and is not restricted to JV summaries. In each created graph the data are selected in the corresponding column in each file.

Support for subplots and insets. Examples can be found in examples/_subplots_insets.
- A suplot can be created by inserting or casting a Curve of type "subplot".
  When the attribute subplotfile is set and indicate a data file, that file is shown as a subplot to the graph. The created axis is then used for the next Curves to be plotted, until a new Subplot Curve is found.
- Possibility to place another Graph as an inset in a given graph.
  A Curve must be cast to type "inset". When the attribute insetfile is set and points to a data file, that file is shown as an inset to the graph. Else, the created axis is used for the next Curves.

Modifications:
- Updated the list of ratios keywords for the SIMS processing. Especially are available the ratio keywords cuznsn [Cu]/([Zn+]+[Sn]), cuge [Cu+]/[^70Ge+], and snge [Sn+]/[^70Ge+].
- Improved handling of units when creating boxplots. The units is now consistent with units user preferences.
- The boxplot and the JV maps scripts do now generate identical output format whether input files were generated at the acquisition machine or from grapa.
- Revised the way the global maps of the JV summaries are created.
- The boxplot script can now generate boxplots from any files a folder. If the initial file is not identified as a JV summary, a boxplot is created for each column of the data files.
- The boxplot script can now create boxplots from various data files and is not restricted to JV summaries. In each created graph the data are selected in the corresponding column in each file.
- Curves attributes are further tested for interpretation. Previous behavior is that unrecognized keywords were checked for their presence in the prototype of the used plot method (e.g. ax.plot, ax.semilgy, etc.).
  Now, in addition unused keywords are also checked for the presence of a setter method on the curves handle. Assuming a keyword key with value val and a (list of) handle created via h = ax.plot(...), the method h.set_"key"(val) will be called (provided it exists). Thus for example 'markevery': 3 can be correctly interpreted.

Bugs solved:
- The boxplots should be safe from a nan value in the data. The boxplot script crashed when such input was provided.
- The boxplot script was generating undesired files in the folder of the application launcher.
- The behavior of shifting Curves up or down is now consistent. The error messages are not displayed anymore.
- The software now correctly reads labels with including carriage returns when opening a file
- Corrected the red-to-green color of some graphs generated when mapping a JV summary file.





Version 0.4.0.2
Release 21.09.2017
Additions
- Implemented a configuration file. The file can be specified at startup in a command line launcher: ie. C:\pythonpath\python.exe C:\graphapath\grapa\GUI.py %1 config.txt
- The default presentation of graph axis units and symbols can be tuned in the config, using the keywords graph_labels_units ([], () or /) and graph_labels_symbols (True, False)
- The default colorscales can now be configured in the config file
- Export of files in .emf file possible. Inkscape is required to perform the conversion from an .svg image, and the path can be configured in the config file

- Renames example files to get "anonymous" examples




Version 0.4:
Release 07.07.2017
- The files have been reorganized in order to comply to the usual Python package organisation. In principle it should be possible to install the package etc.
  This involved a bit of file renaming, rewriting and so on. Existing scripts might not run immediately.
  The main changes are:
      - Files renamed (ie. remove the 'class_' prefix, set lowercase latters, etc.),
      - Class Measure was renamed into Graph.
      - Class xyCurve was renamed into Curve. Backward compatibility of saved graphs should be ensured.
Additions
- Added support for various matplotlib plot functions: acorr, angle_spectrum, bar, barbs, barh, cohere, csd, eventplot, fill_between, fill_betweenx, hexbin, hist, hist2d, magnitude_spectrum, phase_spectrum, pie, plot_date, psd, quiver, specgram, spy, stackplot, stem, step, triplot, xcorr
- Added a keyword "['key', value]" in the New property drop-down list. This allows creating arbitrary keywords, for example to provide the desired keyword to the plot methods.
- Added newCurve type: CurveMath, which enables basic arithmetic operations between Curves.
Changes
- Revised xticksstep, yticksstep so the values are more suitable (if the step is smaller than the default one, then the default values will be shown)
- Upgraded legendlocation keyword, which can handle kwargs to the legend() function cal. Example: {'loc': 'sw', 'bbox_to_anchor':(0.1, 0.05)}
- The legend font size can now be modified by performing update({'legendlocation':{'fontsize': 8}})
- The offste and muloffset can be directly edited in the Curves actions.
- Saving with the option "Transformed data (better not)" Transform now saves data modified for offset and muloffset
- Colorscales can now handle rbga quadruplets as well (and so is able to handle transparency)

Bugs:
- Corrected a bug preventing the opening of some SIMS profiles with complicated shapes of Ga+In curve
- Can now colorize correctly boxplots from JV summary files, with arbitrary RBG tri/quadruplets
- Corrected a bug preventing saving with the extension .TXT.
- Script process JV: the graphical summary files now contain the cell performance data. vminmax now can be set to correct values.
- Script JV sample map: can impose cmap (colorscale) from the JV summary file
Under the hood
- When scripting, can now perform arithmetic operation on curves (ex: curveA / curveB). By default will interpolate data on the merged x series.
- Curve.__add__ now accepts an argument 'operator', which can be set to 'sub', 'mult' or 'div'. Setting it to 'sub' overrides the sub argument.



Version 0.3.8.10
Release 11.05.2017
Additions:
- if 'subplots_adjust' last element is "abs", then the values given are intepreted as absolute margins instead of relative.
- Curve EQE: current calc now allows a ROI to be set.
- The Curve with type 'fill' now can get a legend
- Added a keyword 'colorbar' to Curves, which adds a colorbar to Curves with a cmap (i.e. scatter).

- The JV boxplot script failed when mixing summaries of the JV acquisition software and generating when processing JV fits.


Version 0.3.8.9
Release 02.05.2017
Added:
- New type of plot: errorbar type of plot. 2 corresponding keywords were added: xerr, and yerr.
  Error bars can be specified for each datapoint, by setting the keyword 'type' of the next Curve(s) as 'errorbar_xerr' and/or 'errorbar_yerr'.
- New keyword: markeredgecolor
- When substracting Curves (i.e. Curve Spectrum dakr substraction), a keyword appears in the CUrve properties indicating which operation was performed.
Adjustments:
- The graph can now be shown larger than 600x400 px when resizing the application window.

BUGS
- Solved an issue with cell area correction when batch-processing JV data, when only the dark or only the illuminated data where acquired.
- Solved a memory leak when running scripts JV, CV, Cf, boxplots. The plots are now closed after generation, freeing the memory.
- Solved a bug with mappings of JV summaries.
- xlim and ylim also work with '' to let the boundary adapt to the data, not only with inf and nan.
- Solved a bug preventing opening a file when a CurveEQE file had a numeric as label.

Version 0.3.8.5
Release 03.04.2017
New features
- Curve Jsc-Voc: handles Jsc-Voc data pairs from the cryo setup. Functions are:
  Cell area normalization, N & J0 fitting, and data splitting into different temperatures.
  The plots A vs T, J0 vs T and J0 vs A*T are generated, and the last one can readily be fitted with an Arrhenius relation.
- Added a mode 'ExtrapolateTo0' to CurveArrhenius: it is actually not an Arrhenius relation, and does what it's name says it does (fit with 1st degree polynom)
  The Vbi vs T graph of the script Curve CV is of this type per default. 
Adjustments
- Improved general software speed. (graph updates not initiated when moving in the property tree, updates are >2x faster)
- Button "Save" offers a choice in the filename if the software thinks it's at risk to erase raw data.
- Scatter curves can now be adjusted in color and size, provided the next curves have the keywords scatter_c or scatter_s. Offset and muloffset keywords can be used to adjust the size.
- TRPL: default fit ROI starts at 20 ns.
Bugs:

Under the hood
- Adjustements to CurveArrhenius, it is now way easier to implement new models / data treatments.



Version 0.3.8.4
Release 30.03.2017
New features
- Added a "Substract dark" Button for Spectrum Curves.
  Choice is given to perform element-wise or by interpolation, as well as to update or replace the existing Curve.
  Any Curve can be casted into CurveSpectrum to perform a substraction, then casted back in his original type.
